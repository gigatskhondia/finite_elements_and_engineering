 # Finite elements and engineering solutions to cool classical textbooks in Python

In this repo you can find my solutions to cool old-school hard-core textbooks in finite elements methods and engineering. 
 
Solution for the following sources are covered: 
1. Applied Finite Element Analysis, 2nd Edition, Larry J. Segerlind
2. [Python and Finite Element Methods: A Match Made in Heaven?](https://gigatskhondia.medium.com/python-and-finite-element-methods-a-match-made-in-heaven-ee2ed7ca14ee)
3. Finite Element Procedures, by Klaus-JÃ¼rgen Bathe (in progress)
4. Dynamics of Offshore Structures, Wilson
